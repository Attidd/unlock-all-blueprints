# How to install
Download the mod from https://github.com/nuzkito/unlock-all-blueprints/releases/download/1.0.0/Unlock_Blueprints.zip

Go to the local mod folder and unzip it. By default, in Windows is: `%USERPROFILE%\Documents\Klei\OxygenNotIncluded\mods\Local`.

Open the game, enable the mod and restart the game.

Now, you should be able to use any blueprint for your buildings and wardrobe.

# How blueprints works?
Each week, 3 new blueprints are unlocked for your account in Klei servers. You need to enable data communication in the options menu if you want to get the blueprints in the game (Options > Data Communication > Check Enable Data Communication).

You can view a history of all your drops, what did you sell and buy, and your filaments in your Klei account https://accounts.klei.com/account/transactions. That page contains all blueprints from Oxygen Not Included and also Don't Starve Together.

# What does this mod do?
The mod tells the game that all blueprints have an universal rarity. Blueprints with universal rarity are the default ones, and they are always unlocked, so the game thinks that all blueprints are unlocked when, in reality, the Klei servers say otherwise.

# What happens if you uninstall the mod?
You will have access to the blueprints unlocked using the Klei servers. You will lose access to not unlocked blueprints.

If you built something with a not unlocked blueprint using the mod, that building will continue to have the blueprint in your game, but if you destroy it, you won't be able to build it again.
